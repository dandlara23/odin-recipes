    <h3>What is Prime Rib?</h3>
    <p>Prime rib is a classic roast beef preparation made from the beef rib primal cut, usually roasted with the bone in and served with a simple pan sauce made from its natural juices.</p>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whoel rib eye roast</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. olibe oil</li>
        <li> 1/2 c. kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 tbsp. tri-color peppercorns</li>
        <li>3 sprigs rosemary</li>
        <li>3 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 c. minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p> <li>Preheat oven to 500°F</li> </p>
        <p> <li>Cut rib loin in half</li> <p>
        <p> <li>Sear both halves in olive oil over very high heat until nice dark golden color. Place tricolor peppercorns into a bag, crush pepper corns with a rolling pin. Strip the leaves from the rosemary and thyme springs. Mix salt, crushed peppercorns, rosemary leaves, thyme leaves and garlic.</li> <p>
        <p> <li>Pour olive oil over the rib loin and pour on the rub mix. Pat slightly to get it to stick to the meat. Roast for 20-30 minutes at 500 degrees, then reduce heat to 300°F and roast for another 20 to 30 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 125 for rare/medium rare (roast will continue to cook slightly after removing from the oven.) NOTE: If you'd like the meat more cooked, leave it in the oven longer. Just keep an eye on the meat thermometer and don't let it cook past medium rare! **USING A MEAT THERMOMETER IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE YOU COOK THE MEAT TO YOUR LIKING***</li> <p>
        <p> <li>Remove from oven and let rest at least 20 minutes before slicing.</li> <p>
    </ol>
